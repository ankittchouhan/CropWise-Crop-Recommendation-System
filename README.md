# CropWise: An Intelligent Crop Recommendation System

**CropWise** is a machine learning-based web application designed to recommend the most suitable crop based on various soil and environmental factors. The system leverages agricultural data to help farmers make data-driven decisions about crop selection, improving yield and sustainability.

## Overview
Agricultural productivity is highly dependent on the proper selection of crops based on soil characteristics and climate conditions. **CropWise** aims to simplify this process by using machine learning to predict the best crop for a particular region based on soil nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium content, temperature, humidity, pH level, and rainfall data.

The application is built using Flask for the web interface and a machine learning model trained on crop data to make accurate crop recommendations.

## Features
- User-friendly web interface for farmers and agriculture enthusiasts.
- Input soil and environmental data such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.
- Accurate crop prediction based on a trained machine learning model.
- Responsive design for easy use on mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: Backend web framework for Python.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model building.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend web development.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive web design.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Git
- Virtualenv (optional)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ankittchouhan/CropWise-Crop-Recommendation.git
cd CropWise-Crop-Recommendation
```

### Step 2: Set up the Virtual Environment
```
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate 
```

### Step 3: Install Required Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the Application
```
python app.py
```

## Usage
Once the application is running, navigate to the web interface where you can input the following parameters:

- **Nitrogen (N):** Nitrogen content in the soil.
- **Phosphorus (P):** Phosphorus content in the soil.
- **Potassium (K):** Potassium content in the soil.
- **Temperature (°C):** The temperature of the environment.
- **Humidity (%):** Humidity level in the air.
- **pH Level:** The pH of the soil.
- **Rainfall (mm):** The amount of rainfall in the region.

After entering the data, click on the Predict Crop button to get a recommendation of the most suitable crop for your soil and environmental conditions.
